        Create an entire bracket of two-player teams indicating who is
        on each team and who will be playing one another. All teams and matchups
        are randomized. Also handles players who should not be put on the
        same team (see NOTE).

        Parameters:
        -----------
        - filepath (str) : path to a file containing the names of players to
            be included in the bracket. Files must contain one player's name on
            each line. If this parameter is passed, `names` cannot also be included.
        - names (list) : a list of names (strings) of the players to be included
            in the bracket. If this parameter is passed, `filepath`
            cannot also be included.
        
        NOTE: Players that should not be put on the same team can be handled by
            including *after* a player's name the `!!` immediately followed by
            the players that they can't be paired with. For example:
            
            ---- Example file ----
            Tom Brady
            Billy Bob Thorton
            Kanye West !!Pete Davidson
            Stevie Nicks
            Angelina Jolie !!Billy Bob Thorton
            Pete Davidson
            ----------------------

            ---- Example list ----
            lst = ['Tom Brady', 'Billy Bob Thorton', 'Kanye West !!Pete Davidson',
            'Stevie Nicks', 'Angelina Jolie !!Billy Bob Thorton', 'Pete Davidson']
            ----------------------

            In the above example Kanye West would never be put on the same
            team as Pete Davidson because we included `!!Pete Davidson` after
            his name.
            
        REMEMBER:
        1. There should be no space between the `!!` and the name.
        2. It doesn't matter if you include both the pairs that can't match on
            both lines. For instance, we don't need to include `!!Kanye West`
            on the line that starts with `Pete Davidson`.
        3. As you can see, the strings within a list should be input exactly
            the same way as the lines on the file.
